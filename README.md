inventory-buddy
===============

Small inventory manager

Application built using python/tkinter to help manage the
stock of nutritional supplements we keep where I work. They
have different styles (High Calorie, Clear, High Protein, etc.)
as well as different flavors. I initially attempted something
like this in a text file which I quickly learned was not the
right way to do it. I switched over to csv and had a much
easier time. I've been using it at work for a few months now
and loving it. I still need to add some exception handling
and probably rework some of the code but it functions for now.
